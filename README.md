# ANA515_Assignment4

This is the assignment No.4 for the course ANA515, MS Data Analytics, McDaniel College
The repository contains the output word file, the r markdown file, the datasets, and the style file. 

I am sorry for I didn't realize that I must select a project from the list provided. This week I am having periodontitis of wisdom teeth and I haven't got my health insurance, and I suffered from terrible continuous pain and fever every day...it is very hard to concentrate or to keep my mind clear...I tried my best on the assignment, but it wasn't before I finished it that I realized it asked me to select a given project...

Sorry for that...This project was created by myself aiming to study the relationship of COVID-19 cases and deaths, which is usually called "death rate". Death rate for a certain type of virus usually remains as a constant, but sometimes it will be influenced by several other factors, for example, super-spreader that spreads a variation of the virus that has a higher fatality rate, or for another example, better health care system with higher capacity that saves more people. There are some sayings about death rate difference between regions, and I want to really dive into this issue and see if it is really a constant or not, if the growth of covid cases influences it. That is why I also tried log-linear model and quadratic model.
